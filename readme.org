* ~vep-classifiers-julia~: Julia-based machine learning models for VEP classification

** To-do items for this readme file
- TODO: Mention that this is a slightly rewritten subset of ~classifiers-0~
- TODO: Mention that this currently contains classifiers for CCVEPs only
- TODO: Provide an overview of the project structure
- TODO: Provide instructions on how to load the packages with Julia
- TODO: Recommend calling ~populate_fft_plan_cache~ and provide an example
- TODO: Mention PyJulia and the conda environment example file
- TODO: Mention row- and column-major order of matrices in Python vs. Julia

** To-do list for the repository beyond this readme file
- TODO: Make sure manifests exist for all Julia projects
- TODO: In ~classifiers-0~, parallelization was only employed at the level of
  cross-validation, hyperparameter search, and evaluating multiple distinct
  datasets at once. As the model is now meant to be used in online BCI contexts
  where a single classifier has to be trained swiftly on a single take set,
  parallelization at a lower level (either the regression algorithm or the
  matrix multiplications) would be prudent.
